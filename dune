; now we tell you how to define a custom rule 
; rule start with (rule )

(rule
 ; (alias is point  the command name , so you can run this rule by call  dune build @docopen
 (alias docopen)
 ; following line is very important, it tell dune do not cache this build command, so it will running every call without any cache
 (deps (universe))
 ; action  (system  to told system run command by `sh` in your Linux/MacOS, windows user may running cmd.exe 
 ; cd ../.. is change the base directory of the running command ,or the default directory will be _build/default  
 (action
  (system
   "set -ex && cd ../.. && pwd  && rm -rf _build/default/_doc && dune clean && dune build @doc --verbose && open _build/default/_doc/_html/index.html")))

; end of one piece of rule

; and we define more and more rule as we want 

(rule
 (alias whoami)
 (deps (universe))
 (action
  (system "set -ex && uname -a;whoami")))

(rule
 (alias ff)
 (deps (universe))
 (action
  (system
   "set -ex && cd ../.. && pwd && dune clean && dune build @fmt --verbose --auto-promote")))
